# What's difference from default stairs smart prop?
Default stairs smart prop "test_steps.vsmart" lacks some of basic features that I tried to fix. Here's list of new features:
1. Clockwise rotation: default prop can rotate only counterclockkwise which is the actual reason of creating this prop
2. Styles: you can now select exact faces you'd like to see
3. Additional materials: you can pick grid or reflectivity30b texture for better visual blocking
4. Tweaked sliders for step width and step height
