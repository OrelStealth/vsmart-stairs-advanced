# What's difference from default stairs smart prop?
Default stairs smart prop "test_steps.vsmart" lacks some of basic features that I tried to fix. Here's a list of new features:
1. Clockwise rotation: default prop can rotate only counterclockwise, which is the actual reason of creating this prop
2. Styles: you can now select exact faces you'd like to see
3. Additional materials: you can pick grid or reflectivity30b texture for better visual blocking
4. Clipping: adds additional mesh with clip tool texture (This will be removed on smart prop collapse. Also works not so well on curved stairs)
5. Downstairs option
6. Choose from 9 different surface properties, which might be useful for blocking levels with specific surface step sounds
7. Tweaked sliders for step width and step height
