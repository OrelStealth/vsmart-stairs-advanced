# What's difference from default stairs smart prop?
Default stairs smart prop "test_steps.vsmart" lacks some of basic features that I tried to fix. Here's list of new features:
1. Clockwise rotation: default prop can rotate only counterclockkwise which is the actual reason of creating this prop
2. Styles: you can now select exact faces you'd like to see
3. Additional materials: you can pick grid or reflectivity30b texture for better visual blocking
4. Clipping: adds additional mesh with clip tool texture(This will be removed on smart prop collapse. Also works not so well on curved stairs)
5. Downstairs option
6. Tweaked sliders for step width and step height
